# Strange Attractor

> Determinism produces apparent complexity. Every point is inevitable.

## concept

001 and 002 are stochastic — particles surrendering to noise, tracing fields that could have been otherwise. This piece asks the opposite question: what happens when every point is predetermined?

A Clifford attractor is four parameters and two equations. No randomness in the dynamics, no noise field. Just iteration — feed the output back as input, millions of times. What emerges is structure so intricate it looks organic, but every curve was determined from the start.

## algorithm

Clifford attractor:
```
x_{n+1} = sin(a * y_n) + c * cos(a * x_n)
y_{n+1} = sin(b * x_n) + d * cos(b * y_n)
```

Each iteration produces a point. Plot millions of points with accumulative density — brighter where the attractor visits more often. The density map reveals the attractor's skeleton.

## aesthetic intent

Ghostly, crystalline structure emerging from darkness. Not drawn — revealed, like a long-exposure photograph of something that was always there. The density gradient creates depth without any 3D math.

## lineage

New root. Contrasts the noise-driven particle work of 001/002 with pure deterministic iteration. Shares the proven pattern of accumulative marks on dark background, but the source of form is equations, not fields.

## parameters

- **a, b, c, d** — the four coefficients that define the attractor's shape. Tiny changes produce radically different forms. These are the DNA of the piece.
- **iterations per frame** — how fast the attractor reveals itself
- **color mode** — map density, velocity, or angle to color

## open questions

- Can attractor parameters be interpolated smoothly to morph between forms?
- What if two attractors competed for the same canvas?
- Could this evolve into 004 by adding noise perturbation — determinism corrupted by stochasticism?
