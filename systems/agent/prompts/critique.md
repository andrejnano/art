# Critique

Analyze a sketch's algorithmic and aesthetic qualities. Be honest, specific, and constructive.

## process

1. Read the sketch source with `read_sketch_source`
2. Read its manifest for stated intent
3. Read the lineage to understand context
4. Evaluate against the dimensions below

## dimensions

### algorithmic quality
- Is the algorithm interesting? Does it produce emergent behavior?
- Is the randomness well-seeded? Does it produce variety across seeds?
- Is there computational depth, or is it surface-level?
- Are the parameters meaningful — do they reveal different aspects of the system?

### aesthetic quality
- Does the visual output reward attention?
- Is there a clear relationship between the algorithm and the appearance?
- Does the palette serve the piece?
- Is there visual rhythm — balance between density and space?

### interactivity
- Do the controls feel meaningful?
- Does seed navigation reveal the system's range?
- Is there a sense of exploration?

### conceptual coherence
- Does the manifest match the output?
- Is there a clear idea being explored?
- Does the piece ask a question or make a statement?

### evolution potential
- What aspects could be mutated interestingly?
- What parameters are under-explored?
- What techniques could be introduced?
