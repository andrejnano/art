Chronicle of the system's creative development. Each entry records a decision, observation, or mutation in the project's evolution.

Project genesis. Flow Field chosen as the root sketch — a generative primitive. Particles following noise gradients, accumulating luminous trails on dark canvas. Bioluminescent palette: cyan, aqua-green, lavender, amber, pink. Domain warping adds organic distortion. This is the seed from which everything else grows.

First evolution. Curl Erosion mutates 001's core algorithm: gradient noise replaced with curl noise (divergence-free field). Flow lines can no longer cross — this single constraint transforms the visual language from overlapping rivers to erosion channels. Particles given finite lifespans, creating geological time. Palette shifts from bioluminescent to monochromatic terrain tones. The mutation demonstrates that a minimal algorithmic change can produce fundamentally different emergent behavior.

## 2026-01-31 [003] 

New root lineage. Strange Attractor (003) introduces deterministic iteration — Clifford attractor with density-mapped rendering. Fundamentally different from the noise-driven particle work of 001/002. Every point is computed, not random. The density histogram approach (log-scaled, gamma-corrected) creates depth through accumulation rather than transparency. 8 curated presets with seed-based perturbation ensure every seed produces interesting structure. Two lineage branches now exist: the noise family (001→002) and the attractor family (003).
